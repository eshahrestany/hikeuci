        </h2>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-midnight/90">
          <span class="font-semibold">Founded in 2015</span>, our club has grown from a small group of outdoor enthusiasts into one of UCIâ€™s most active student organizations. Over the past decade, we've logged thousands of trail miles and fostered a supportive community that welcomes hikers of all experience levels.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-midnight/90">
          Hiking club explores trails all across Orange County, and add new ones to our schedule every year. Whether you are looking to enjoy the scenery, challenge your hiking skills, or simply make new friends, we would love for you to join us.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-midnight/90">
